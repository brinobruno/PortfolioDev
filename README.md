# Portfolio Dev

### (In progress...)

This will be my next portfolio, now using better technologies, methods and structure.
Needless to say, I'll be focusing more on my experience as a Dev so far.

As for the project itself, I'm commited to make it with React and afterwards, work on a NextJS version.

I made the UI design using Figma, not 100% complete as well and I hope to react an optimal result. This is the link if you wish to see it:
